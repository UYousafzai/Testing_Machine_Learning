# Testing_Machine_Learning
So I found a scikit cheat sheet of selecting algorithms and so I tested out a few things, to see how it went according to the cheat sheet, the word document explains the rest and you can compare the results yourself to see what results I got.

oh and you can run the notebook file with the extension ".ipynb" in jupyter.
